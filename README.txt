Repository contains sketches used to control the pyranometer mount consisting of two Zaber T-RS60A rotational stages.  Tracking methods include open-loop (feed forward), closed-loop (feedback), and dual-mode (both).  Also included are sketches used in testing various Zaber stage commands in binary protocol.

Copy Zaber_X, TinyGPSPlus-master, and sun_position folders into your Arduino/libraries folder before using.
